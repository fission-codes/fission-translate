## Summary

Having culturally and linguistically accurate translations is an important and necessary goal for Ethereum. The current state-of-the-art involves providing end users with hard-coded messaging (typically in English). This approach serves only a small segment of the global population. The FISSION Suite attempts to address this issue by providing culturally and linguistically diverse user feedback in a maximally decentralized way.

In order to make [FISSION Codes](https://github.com/expede/fission-codes) accessible to a diverse end user base, FISSION Translate contributors are working towards providing translations of FISSION Codes in different languages, phrasings, and in varying levels of technical detail.

Our collected translations are always evolving. If you would like to submit a translation for review, please see the [Translations Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/jenncoop/fission-translate/blob/master/TRANSLATIONS_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md) for more information.
